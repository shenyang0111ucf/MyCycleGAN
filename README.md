# MyCycleGAN
main.py is the code we write on our own to create GAN based on the paper's description. But the code without optimization has low quality performance and we finally use oldmain.py which uses author's optimization method and add our new feature matching loss and testing codes.

Anyone could use "python oldmain.py" to run the codes.
If you want to change the hyperparameters, you could change then in config.py
